# How to write a Jenkinsfile

In Jenkins pipeline, we have two way of writing Jenkinsfile,
* Scripted way - Older way, we have to write lot of logics
* Declarative way - Newer way, comes with lot of inbuild functions

From [Official Documentation:](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)

```
A Jenkinsfile can be written using two types of syntax - Declarative and Scripted.

Declarative and Scripted Pipelines are constructed fundamentally differently.

Declarative Pipeline is a more recent feature of Jenkins Pipeline which:

  --> provides richer syntactical features over Scripted Pipeline syntax, and

  --> is designed to make writing and reading Pipeline code easier.
