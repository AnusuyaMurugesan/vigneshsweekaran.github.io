The model here is pull and push

Lets say, the `Developer 1` created a file `file-1` in local computer and pushed to file to `Remote repository`

Now the `Developer 2` and `3` can pull the `file-1` from the remote repository to the local computer

Similarly, if the `Developer 3` created a file `file-3` in local computer and pushed to file to `Remote repository`

Now, the other developers can get `file-3` and all other files from the remote repository to the local computer
